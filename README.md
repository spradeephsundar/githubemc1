# Linear Regression - Bike Sharing Assignment
> A US bike-sharing provider "BoomBikes" has suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, the idea is to come up with a mindful business plan, to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

## General Information
- General information: US bike-sharing provider "BoomBikes" would like to come up with a mindful business plan, to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state
- Business probem: The idea is to create a model that predicts the demand for shared bikes, using the available independent variables. This model will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. Based on this understanding, the business team can manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations
- Dataset: The dataset (a csv file) has been provided for this exercise
